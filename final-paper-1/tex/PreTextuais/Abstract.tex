    This work proposes an investigation into type inference for Continuation Passing Style (CPS) - an intermediate representation widely used in compilers for functional languages.
    The research focuses on extending the W algorithm, traditionally used for type inference in the Damas-Milner system, to encompass continuation calculus.
    The proposal includes implementing this extension in the Haskell programming language and validating the algorithm through test programs, ensuring that the inferred types are correct.

    \textbf{Keywords}: Type Inference, Continuation Passing Style (CPS), W Algorithm, Damas-Milner, Haskell, Type System.
