  abstract = {This paper examines the old question of the relationship between ISWIM and the λ-calculus, using the distinction between call-by-value and call-by-name. It is held that the relationship should be mediated by a standardisation theorem. Since this leads to difficulties, a new λ-calculus is introduced whose standardisation theorem gives a good correspondence with ISWIM as given by the SECD machine, but without the letrec feature. Next a call-by-name variant of ISWIM is introduced which is in an analogous correspondence withthe usual λ-calculus. The relation between call-by-value and call-by-name is then studied by giving simulations of each language by the other and interpretations of each calculus in the other. These are obtained as another application of the continuation technique. Some emphasis is placed throughout on the notion of operational equality (or contextual equality). If terms can be proved equal in a calculus they are operationally equal in the corresponding language. Unfortunately, operational equality is not preserved by either of the simulations.}

  abstract  = {We present a series of CPS-based intermediate languages suitable for functional language compilation, arguing that they have practical benefits over direct-style languages based on A-normal form (ANF) or monads. Inlining of functions demonstrates the benefits most clearly: in ANF-based languages, inlining involves a re-normalization step that rearranges let expressions and possibly introduces a new 'join point' function, and in monadic languages, commuting conversions must be applied; in contrast, inlining in our CPS language is a simple substitution of variables for variables.We present a contification transformation implemented by simple rewrites on the intermediate language. Exceptions are modelled using so-called 'double-barrelled' CPS. Subtyping on exception constructors then gives a very straightforward effect analysis for exceptions. We also show how a graph-based representation of CPS terms can be implemented extremely efficiently, with linear-time term simplification.},

The typed assembly language we pressent is based on a conventional RISC assembly language, but its static type sytem provides support for enforcing high-level language abstratctions, such as closures, tuples, and user-defined abstract data types. The type system ensures that well-typed programs cannot violatet these abstractionsl In addition, the typing constructs admit many low-level compiler optimiztaions. Our translation to TAL is specified as a sequence of type-preserving transformations, including CPS and closure conversion phases; type-correct source programs are mapped to type-correct assembly language. A key contribution is an approach to polymorphic   closure conversion that is considerably simpler than previous work. The compiler and typed assembly lanugage provide a fully automatic way to produce certified code, suitable for use in systems where unstrusted and potentially malicious code must be checked for safety before execution.},

Though the primary use of these intermediate representation languages is to expose details about a program's control flow, they may be equipped with an equational theory in order to be seen as specialized calculi, which in turn may be related to the original languages by means of a factorization theorem. In this paper, we explore Thielecke's CPS-calculus, a small theory of continuations inspired by compiler implementations, and study its metatheory. We extend it with a sound reduction semantics that faithfully represents optimization rules used in actual compilers, and prove that it acts as a suitable theoretical foundation for the intermediate representation of Appel's and Kennedy's compilers by following the guidelines set out by Plotkin. Finally, we prove that the CPS-calculus is strongly normalizing in the simply typed setting by using a novel proof method for reasoning about reducibility at a distance, from which logical consistency follows. Taken together, these results close a gap in the existing literature, providing a formal theory for reasoning about intermediate representations.},

  abstract  = {A type system is a syntactic method for automatically checking the absence of certain erroneous behaviors by classifying program phrases according to the kinds of values they compute. The study of type systems -- and of programming languages from a type-theoretic perspective -- has important applications in software engineering, language design, high-performance compilers, and security.This text provides a comprehensive introduction both to type systems in computer science and to the basic theory of programming languages. The approach is pragmatic and operational; each new concept is motivated by programming examples and the more theoretical sections are driven by the needs of implementations. Each chapter is accompanied by numerous exercises and solutions, as well as a running implementation, available via the Web. Dependencies between chapters are explicitly identified, allowing readers to choose a variety of paths through the material.The core topics include the untyped lambda-calculus, simple type systems, type reconstruction, universal and existential polymorphism, subtyping, bounded quantification, recursive types, kinds, and type operators. Extended case studies develop a variety of approaches to modeling the features of object-oriented languages.}

  author    = {Church, Alonzo},
  abstract  = {The purpose of the present paper is to give a formulation of the
               simple theory of types which incorporates certain features of
               the calculus of $\lambda$-conversion. A complete incorporation
               of the calculus of $\lambda$-conversion into the theory of types
               is impossible if we require that $\lambda$x and juxtaposition
               shall retain their respective meanings as an abstraction
               operator and as denoting the application of function to
               argument. But the present partial incorporation has certain
               advantages from the point of view of type theory and is offered
               as being of interest on this basis (whatever may be thought of
               the finally satisfactory character of the theory of types as a
               foundation for logic and mathematics).For features of the
               formulation which are not immediately connected with the
               incorporation of $\lambda$-conversion, we are heavily indebted
               to Whitehead and Russell, Hilbert and Ackermann, Hilbert and
               Bernays, and to forerunners of these, as the reader familiar
               with the works in question will recognize.The class of type
               symbols is described by the rules that {\i} and o are each type
               symbols and that if $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are type symbols then
               ($\alpha$$\beta$) is a type symbol: it is the least class of
               symbols which contains the symbols {\i} and o and is closed
               under the operation of forming the symbol ($\alpha$$\beta$) from
               the symbols $\alpha$ and $\beta$.},
