    In the field of compilers, intermediate representations (IR) play a fundamental role, particularly in production environmnents.
    Continuation Passing Style (CPS) is one such representation, notable for functional languages due to the advanced optimizations it enables.
    However, research and implementations of CPS with well-typed terms remains limited, which restricts the detection of certain classes of errors during compilation stages.
    This work investigates the formalization of a type system for CPS and develops a type inference algorithm for this representation, along with its implementation in the Haskell programming language.

    \textbf{Keywords}: Type Inference, Continuation Passing Style (CPS), Damas-Milner, Haskell, Type System.
